The purpose of this app is to offer emergency help by allowing willing users to register and enter their skills (e.g. have taken courses on first aid) and the first aid medicine they usually walk around with (eg. EpiPens for people with severe allergies, asthma inhalers for people with asthma, antihistamines for allergies…).

When a user suddenly needs their medication (e.g. if they had an anaphylactic shock), after calling an ambulance, them (or the people they are with) can go on the app and ask for a certain medication or for someone with a particular first aid skill, the app will then notify any matching users in a certain radius so that they can come and help.

It was created as part of the Software Development Project [CS-306](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/software-development-project-CS-306-1)
class at EPFL.
